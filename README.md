# i3snelock
Script that augments the functionality of i3lock.
Inspired by https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen. 

Dependencies
____________

This script uses feh, xdpyinfo, escrotum, and ffmpeg.

Features
________

Allows for various lockscreen configurations including dim+blurred wallpaper, blurred wallpaper, and simply blurring the contents of the current screen. As opposed to using i3color's built in `blur` function, this alternative allows for fancy background overlays without compromising on speed (thanks for ffmpeg).
